# Python-projects
A simple application for saving the entries or exists from a store or hostel or organisation
A txt file was created to save data. It stores the data in dictionary format a key and its corresponding value
the value dumping and loading was done with the help of json 
the loading of file takes place when the application was started
And the adding and removing are placed in the dictionary and finally it was saved in the txt file
# Thank you
